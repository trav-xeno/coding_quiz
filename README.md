# coding_quiz

I wrtoe this project using Jquery. This simply has a timed quiz that displays questions as the user clicks.
If the user runs out of time score the score zero and teh quiz ends. At the end of the quiz the user can add their intails and it will get added teh score list.

## Javascript

I frist creaed a question list of question objects.
I then used a counter to store where in the question list the user was. The main driver of the app is through the answeer buttons. The rest of hte app is a simple use of local storage and utilization of Jquery.
