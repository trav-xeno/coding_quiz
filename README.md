# coding_quiz

I wrote this project using Jquery. This simply has a timed quiz that displays questions as the user clicks.
If the user runs out of time score their score will be zero and the quiz ends. At the end of the quiz the user can add their initials and it will get added to the score list.

## View The App

[ this is the github page link!](https://trav-xeno.github.io/coding_quiz/)

## Javascript

The main driver of the app is through the user interactions on the answeer buttons.
I frist created a list of question objects.
I then used a counter to store where in the question list the user was, incremented when the user clicked an answer. The rest of hte app is a simple use of local storage and utilization of Jquery.

## Attempted

I tried to create a custom element in pure JS that took in the question object, but couldn't get it to display sadly.
I then tried to do the project in typescript, but ended up just using pure JS. Next project I will use either Elm or angular! just a heads up ;)
