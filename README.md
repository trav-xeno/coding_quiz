# coding_quiz

I wrote this project using Jquery. This simply has a timed quiz that displays questions as the user clicks.
If the user runs out of time score their score will be zero and the quiz ends. At the end of the quiz the user can add their initials and it will get added to the score list.

## View The App

[ this is the github page link!](https://trav-xeno.github.io/coding_quiz/)

## Javascript

I frist created a list of question objects.
I then used a counter to store where in the question list the user was, incremented when the user clicked an answer. The main driver of the app is through the answeer buttons. The rest of hte app is a simple use of local storage and utilization of Jquery.
